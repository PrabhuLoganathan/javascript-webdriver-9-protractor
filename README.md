# QA Testing Case Kata

### QA Engineer assignment
 
Please access the following sample application - http://computerdatabase.herokuapp.com/computers

* Create a series of manual test cases that cover the CRUD operation plus the edge cases. Make
sure you give detailed instructions for each test case (pre conditions, steps, expected results). You
can use any format you want.
* Write scripts that would automate the manual test cases that you see fit to be included in a
regression test set. Please use any of below programming languages:
  * Javascript (preferred)
  * Java (preferred)
  * Python
  * Ruby

(*Please avoid frameworks that only record test cases.*)

* When the assessment is completed, please push the file containing the manual test cases and the
automation project to GitHub.
